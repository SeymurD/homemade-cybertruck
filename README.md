### Introduction

The inspiration to build my own small replica of the Cybertruck was fueled by the shear want of trying to create something myself from the ground up and test myself to make something fun and exciting. Having worked on robots for a while in University project teams, I wanted to invest some money into my own maker gear such as a 3D printer, soldering stations, oscilloscope and all the small electronics to make this machine come to life.

The following will be a log of how my work on this progresses on starting from the model crafted in Fusion 360. As of now, I have probably spent around 1 1/2 months sizing, sketching and modelling the truck to be as close in proportion and stance as the real world beast. The greatest challenge in designing the shell of this vehicle is working both with the restrcition on my 3D printer in terms of accuracy, build volume, and part complexity such that I don't have overhangs present in every part. The chassis of was built from aluminium U-Channel beam for structural rigidity and stretches 24" in length. The length is actually closer to 28" when taking into the account the 3D printed rear end. The images below capture the overall design and placement of the interals using some of the rendering tools provided in Fusion360.
